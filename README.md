# Advent of Code 2025

My Python solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

Each day lives in its own folder (`day-01`, `day-02`, `day-03`, `day-04`, `day-05`,....) with scripts and inputs for that puzzle. 

Clone the repo, `cd` into a day, and run the Python files to see the answers.
